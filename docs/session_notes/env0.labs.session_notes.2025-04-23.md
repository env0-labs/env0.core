# env0.labs Session Notes — 2025-04-23

## Design Philosophy

- AI will be used only for **writing support** — not real-time narrative generation.
- Focus on authored systems that simulate memory, judgment, and decay — not improvisation.
- Systems exist to reveal constraint, not to simulate intelligence.

## Audio Design

- Three-tier sound model adopted:
  - FX (tactile)
  - Ambience (environmental)
  - Symbolic (emotional, narrative, tonal)
- All audio will be low-fidelity by design (8-bit mono, bitcrushed, aliased).
- Reverb and smearing will be treated as expressive tools, not polish.

## Behavioral Systems

- Player behavior will be tracked locally and interpreted via response cues:
  - `firstInputDelay`
  - `avgCharTime`
  - `commandLatency`
  - `repeat patterns`
- No meaning parsed; only behavioral inference used for tone or system reaction.

## Narrative Simulation Boundaries

- Narrative response system to be entirely scripted and responsive, not generative.
- Shadow voice and system voice patterns curated by emotional tags and entropy index.
- No voice line will be generated by AI during runtime.
