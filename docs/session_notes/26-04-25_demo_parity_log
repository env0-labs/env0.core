# 📋 Phase 2b Terminal Engine Stabilization Overview

---

## 🛠️ Terminal Engine Hardening and Modernization

| Area | What Changed | Status |
|:-----|:-------------|:-------|
| Output lifecycle | Rebuilt `println()` to push real new lines into buffer | ✅ Done |
| Typing lifecycle | Reintroduced `overwriteLastLine()` to allow same-line editing | ✅ Done |
| Buffer growth | `writeText()`, `writeLine()` structured properly | ✅ Done |
| Scroll lifecycle | Implemented real `scrollToBottom()` using `viewportStartRow` | ✅ Done |
| Redraw lifecycle | Updated `drawFromBuffer()` to respect `viewportStartRow` and `maxRows` | ✅ Done |
| Prompt redraw | Corrected `refreshLine()` to track cursor relative to viewport | ✅ Done |

## 📦 Buffer and Viewport Management

| Component | Status |
|:----------|:-------|
| `terminalBuffer.js` | Regenerated cleanly (buffer, viewportStartRow, clamping) |
| `canvasTerminal.js` | Added `getTerminalRows()`, ensured clean dimension reporting |
| `env0.terminal.js` | Updated `scrollToBottom()` to properly align viewport |
| `terminalRenderer.js` | Patched `drawFromBuffer()` to draw based on viewport window |
| `terminalHandler.js` | Refactored `refreshLine()` for buffer-safe, viewport-aware typing |

## 🖥️ Shell UX Behavior Restoration

| Area | Result |
|:-----|:-------|
| Typing flow | Clean, non-chaotic, one line at a time |
| Output flow | Commands output grow buffer, scroll view cleanly |
| Command recall (basic) | Planned, queued for future expansion (not broken) |
| Scroll comfort | Mass outputs (`ifconfig`, `ls`, `cat`) scroll cleanly now |
| Boot sequence stability | Boot logs scroll naturally into view |

✅ Terminal now behaves like a degraded real shell would — **without faked hacks**.

---

## 🛡️ Technical Discipline Enforced

| Practice | Achieved |
|:---------|:---------|
| Correct TODO markers honored | (e.g., `scrollToBottom` was intentionally left blank to be properly fixed later) |
| Pushed back when UX broke | (haunted typing fixed) |
| No rushing Phase 2b | Took real time to lock scroll, typing, redraw lifecycles |
| Clear commit messages | Proper Phase 2, Phase 2b closure messages logged |

✅ System is now **trustable** for expansion.

✅ Architecture is stable enough for future FX, tone.js integration, and narrative layering.

# 📣 Closing Tone

This phase wasn't about bug fixes —  
it was about **real architectural system hardening**.

- Real buffer history growth.
- Real degraded shell UX.
- Real scrollback buffer lifecycle.
- Real typing discipline.

✅ The system is now professional-grade and expansion-ready.

# 🚦 Next Step

- Review `RESET.md`
- Amend based on current system architecture
- Spin new thread for Phase 3 (Tone, FX, Narrative, etc.)
