# env0.core â€” Session Overview  
**Date:** 27th April, 2025

## 1. Current Engine Status

| Area | Status |
|:-----|:-------|
| Terminal Core | âœ… Stable |
| Shell Input and Output | âœ… Stable |
| Boot Sequence | ðŸŸ¡ Stable but needs future modularization for multi-project use |
| Scrollback Buffer | ðŸŸ¡ Works but stress testing under heavy FX still needed |
| FX Layering | ðŸŸ  Scaffolding to move to multi-canvas structure |
| InputManager | âœ… Modular, ready to accept both keyboard and button-based input |
| Save/Load System | âšª Parked for future implementation |
| Audio System | âšª Stubs exist, full system parked for future implementation |

## 2. Major Strategic Decisions Captured

| Topic | Decision |
|:------|:---------|
| **Multi-Canvas Architecture** | Move to 3 canvas layers: terminalCanvas (text), fxCanvas (visual FX), glassCanvas (physical CRT frame and reflections). |
| **Internal Resolution** | Lock internal canvas resolution at 4K (3840x2160). |
| **Aspect Ratio** | Lock 16:9 ratio across all devices â€” downscale uniformly using CSS transforms if window size doesn't match. |
| **Scaling Method** | Scale `#terminalContainer` uniformly using `transform: scale()` based on screen size at load; no live canvas rescaling. |
| **Input Modes** | Keep input unified. Keyboard input and touch/mouse button input both converge into the same command execution pipeline. |
| **Cursor Behavior** | Terminal cursor blinking is primary and persistent. FX chaos should not interrupt it. |
| **Error Handling** | No real "input errors" â€” manufactured errors allowed for narrative only. No system-breaking unhandled input allowed. |
| **Terminal Locking** | Disable inputManager handling during "lock" events â€” no deeper mutation needed. |
| **Dynamic Scaling During FX Chaos** | Optional for entropy.echo later. For now, stability preferred for node.zero. |
| **Audio System** | Plan for 3 audio categories: FX sounds (typing, success/failure), Atmosphere sounds (CRT hum, static), Narrative event sounds (e.g., structural breaks). Full system parked until later. |
| **Save/Load System** | Parked. Future decision depending on node.zero/entropy.echo needs. |

## 3. Future Parking Lot (For Later Phases)

| Topic | Status |
|:------|:-------|
| FPS Monitoring / Performance Guardrails | ðŸŸ¡ Good to implement if FX stacking gets heavy. |
| Real Dynamic Resolution Handling | ðŸŸ¡ Parked. Current stance: resolution change requires reload. |
| Boot Customization Hooks | ðŸŸ¡ Modular boot system needed for future flexibility. |
| Full Audio Manager Integration | ðŸŸ¡ Planned after visual FX layers are stable. |
| Save/Load Persistence System | ðŸŸ¡ Likely needed for node.zero narrative progress tracking. |

## 4. Mindset Check

âœ… Project remains system-first.  
âœ… No speculative features added prematurely.  
âœ… No architecture drift.  
âœ… Engine evolves only when underlying stability allows.

---

## TL;DR

env0.core remains on stable ground.  
Clear technical and narrative division is preserved (node.zero clean, entropy.echo chaotic).  
System is positioned for clean expansion into full visual FX layering and future project hooks.

## Ready to Move

Next major move (when decided):  
- Finalize multi-canvas setup (terminal + fx + glass).  
- Build default CRT framing into the visual stack.  
- Lock scale behavior.  
- Begin CRT "presence" pass before new features.
