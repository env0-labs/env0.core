# AUDIT_PASS_1.md - Structural Comprehension Audit (No Context Given)

## 1. What is this?
- The project is a **web-based terminal emulator** designed to simulate a retro-style terminal environment.
- It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The domain is interactive terminal emulation, potentially for educational, demo, or entertainment purposes.

---

## 2. What is it supposed to do?
- **Simulate a Terminal Interface:**  
  - Evidence: Terminal commands (`ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `clear`) are implemented in the `/cmds` directory.
  - Responsible Files: `/terminal.html`, `/terminalBoot.js`, command files in `/cmds`.
- **Display Retro Graphics:**  
  - Evidence: Retro terminal images (`70sterminal.png`, `scanlines.png`) and CRT-style CSS (`terminalStyles.css`).
  - Responsible Files: `styles.css`, `terminalStyles.css`.
- **Execute Terminal Commands:**  
  - Evidence: Command tracking file (`commandsStatus.md`) indicates available commands.
  - Responsible Files: `/cmds` directory, `/core/terminal/`.

---

## 3. Does it do what it's supposed to do?
- **Logic Coherence:**  
  - The logic appears coherent but has hidden dependencies (e.g., global state in the renderer).
- **Component Separation:**  
  - Terminal commands, UI, and FX are partially separated, but FX often directly manipulate the canvas.
- **Signs of Instability:**  
  - Deprecated file (`narrative.js`).
  - FX directly manipulate canvas, risking visual instability.
- **Confidence Rating:** Medium-High (70%).

---

## 4. What does not belong?
- **Deprecated File:**  
  - `/narrative.js` - Marked as deprecated but still present.
- **Redundant Files:**  
  - Some FX files have direct canvas manipulation rather than being modular.

---

## 5. Where is it fragile?
- **Global State Handling:**  
  - State is directly manipulated in many modules.
- **FX Direct Canvas Manipulation:**  
  - Visual FX are not isolated from the main rendering logic, risking interference.
- **Boot Logic:**  
  - Boot sequence relies on direct state manipulation and hardcoded messages.

---

## 6. What questions would you ask the original author?
- Why was `narrative.js` not removed if deprecated?
- Are all implemented commands listed in `commandsStatus.md`?
- Is there a structured way to extend the terminal with new commands?
- How are state changes managed across modules to prevent conflicts?
