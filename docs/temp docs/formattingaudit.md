## üìÅ Boot Sequence

| Area | Status | Observations |
|:-----|:-------|:-------------|
| Boot log flow | Functional | Before boot sequence starts it is showing "user@localhost:/$" which is then replaced by boot sequence
Missing instruction for 'next line' |
| MENU visibility | Perfect | Perfect |
| "Press any key" | functional | seems to work, tested 'space' and 'enter' and both worked |
| Transition to prompt | Broken | Triggers 'username' but missing the pre-login text giving username and password (root:toor) when "skip boot sequence" is enabled, no text to show "boot skipped" I assume it's missing in the same with the login details are missing, ALSO upon successful login the prompt appears INSTEAD of the password line, it should appear BELOW the password line |
