# AUDIT_PASS_1.md

## Structural Comprehension Audit (No Context Given)

This audit simulates a new developer or external system being handed the codebase with **no documentation, no background, and no live guidance**.

The task is to answer, using only the code:

---

### 1. What is this?

Describe what the project appears to be.  
- What kind of system is it?  
- What is it structured to simulate or produce?  
- What is the domain or problem space (as inferred from code only)?

---

### 2. What is it supposed to do?

List what major systems, behaviors, or outputs the code *seems* to be trying to produce.  
For each, note:
- What evidence supports this assumption?
- Which files are responsible for delivering it?

---

### 3. Does it do what it's supposed to do?

For each behavior guessed above:
- Is the logic coherent?
- Are components clearly separated?
- Are there signs of instability (e.g., awkward hacks, inconsistent data flow, duplication)?
- Are names, comments, or structure misleading?

Use confidence ratings for each judgment.

---

### 4. What does not belong?

List any modules, files, or functions that appear:
- Out of scope
- Deprecated or unused
- Architecturally misplaced

---

### 5. Where is it fragile?

Identify areas that look brittle, overcomplicated, or liable to break on modification.  
Include:
- Complex conditionals
- State leakage
- Circular dependencies
- Hand-tuned visual logic

---

### 6. What questions would you ask the original author?

List any questions needed to fully understand or safely modify the system.  
These can highlight:
- Implicit design rules
- Missing abstractions
- Areas where intent is unclear

---

### Notes for the Auditor

- Do not attempt to fix or restructure. This is a comprehension and assessment pass only.
- Document your reasoning and uncertainties. Partial guesses are valid.
- Assume this is a production-adjacent system; focus on *intent and clarity*, not stylistic preferences.
