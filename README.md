# env0.core

The engine at the heart of everything in [env0.labs](https://github.com/env0-labs).

This is a CRT-style terminal simulation layer built with `xterm.js`. It handles command input, state management, visual effects, and modular expansion â€” enabling both learning environments and narrative systems to run on top of it.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Modular command registration
- State and input managers
- Boot sequences and login logic
- CRT-style visual effects
- Support for narrative injection, mission tracking, and CLI-driven UX

## ðŸš§ Status
Actively in development. Core architecture is functional but evolving.

This repo is not a demo â€” it's the engine layer used by:
- [node.zero](https://github.com/env0-labs/node.zero) â€” a learning simulation
- [entropy.echo](https://github.com/env0-labs/entropy.echo) â€” a horror narrative
