# env0.core

The engine at the heart of everything in [env0.labs](https://github.com/env0-labs).

This is a CRT-style terminal simulation engine built around a custom canvas-based renderer. `xterm.js` has been fully replaced as of [April 2025] with a bespoke system designed for precision control, glitch fidelity, and narrative adaptability enabling both learning environments and narrative systems to run on top of it.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Modular command registration
- State and input managers
- Boot sequences and login logic
- CRT-style visual effects
- Support for narrative injection, mission tracking, and CLI-driven UX

## ðŸš§ Status
Actively in development. Core architecture is functional but evolving.

This repo is not a demo â€” it's the engine layer used by:
- [node.zero](https://github.com/env0-labs/node.zero) â€” a learning simulation
- [entropy.echo](https://github.com/env0-labs/entropy.echo) â€” a horror narrative
